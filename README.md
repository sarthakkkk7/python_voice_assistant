# 🧠 Python Voice Assistant

This is a Python-based voice assistant that responds to your spoken commands and performs various tasks like opening websites, searching Wikipedia, telling the time, launching applications, and more.

You can choose between a **Male Assistant (Jarvis)** or a **Female Assistant (Friday)** — giving it a more personalized and fun interaction experience! The names for Male and Female assistant are inspired from Tony Stark's AI assistants in Marvel Comics/ Cinematic Universe.
